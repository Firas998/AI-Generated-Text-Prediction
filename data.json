China, which has been accused of manipulating the fuel market, has repeatedly said that it wants to see a full resolution of its own crisis. It last week said an independent investigation had confirmed that the $220m was for the benefit of china operators - and some other suppliers - - who allegedly sold their fuel to China. If this were the case, the whole fiasco would be investigated by the International Red Cross and other agencies, the company said. China's head of finance, Fuyang Liwen, has told the Guardian the government is still looking at the offer. However, an independent source told the Daily Telegraph of two possible financial rescue packages offered by China this week. Both the Treasury and China Oil Federation have indicated that they would offer the $220m - or at least two at a time - if the money was paid back. The final three proposals - and the Treasury have said that they will decide who gets the money now - are to go before the House of Commons next week.
